# Security Architecture (Protect)

"Prevention is ideal, but detection is a must."

Security Architecture is the foundation of the **Protect** function of NIST CSF. It involves designing networks, systems, and applications to be inherently resistant to compromise.

## Core Concepts
1.  **Defense in Depth**: Layering security controls (Perimeter, Network, Endpoint, Data) so that if one fails, others remain.
2.  **Zero Trust**: "Never trust, always verify." Assuming the network is already hostile.
3.  **Least Privilege**: Users and systems should only have the bare minimum access required to function.
