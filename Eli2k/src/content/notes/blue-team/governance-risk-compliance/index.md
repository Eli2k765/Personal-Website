# Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC)

Securing the business, not just the computers.

GRC ensures that IT activities align with business goals (Governance), risks are identified and managed (Risk), and legal/regulatory requirements are met (Compliance).

## The Triad
1.  **Governance**: The strategy. "What are we doing and why?"
2.  **Risk**: The uncertainty. "What could go wrong?"
3.  **Compliance**: The rules. "What must we do?"
