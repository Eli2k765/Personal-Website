# Incident Response (Respond)

"Don't panic."

Incident Response (IR) is the organized approach to addressing and managing the aftermath of a security breach or cyberattack.

## Core Phases (PICERL)

2.  **Identification**: Detect and determine scope.
3.  **Containment**: Stop the bleeding.
4.  **Eradication**: Remove the infection.
5.  **Recovery**: Restore services.
6.  **Lessons Learned**: Improve for next time.
