# Defense Evasion (TA0005)

Defense Evasion consists of techniques that adversaries use to avoid detection throughout their compromise. Techniques used for defense evasion include uninstalling/disabling security software or obfuscating/encrypting data and scripts.

## Strategy
- **Blend In**: Make your activity look like normal user behavior (Masquerading).
- **Blind**: Disable the sensors watching you (Impair Defenses).
- **Hide**: Run your code inside trusted processes (Injection).
