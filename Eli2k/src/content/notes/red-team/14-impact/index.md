# Impact (TA0040)

Impact consists of techniques that adversaries use to disrupt availability or compromise integrity by manipulating business and operational processes. Techniques used for impact can include destroying or tampering with data. In some scenarios, business processes can look fine, but may have been altered to benefit the adversaries’ goals. This tactic is often the "End Game" for ransomware actors.

## Strategy
- **Denial of Service**: Stop the business from functioning.
- **Encryption**: Lock the data and demand payment.
- **Wipe**: Destroy the data (Wiocly).
