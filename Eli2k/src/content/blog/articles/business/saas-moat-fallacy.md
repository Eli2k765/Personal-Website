> "Your margin is my opportunity." — Jeff Bezos

In the golden age of SaaS (2010-2020), we deluded ourselves with the myth of "Meritocracy."
We believed that "Best of Breed" would win. If you built the best chat app (Slack), you would beat the mediocre one (Teams). If you built the best video tool (Zoom), you would beat Google Meet.

We were wrong. We forgot that we don't live in a free market. We live in **Digital Feudalism**.

## The Serf Era (Unbundling)

For 20 years, the strategy was "Unbundling."
The startups were the creative yeoman farmers. **Salesforce** unbundled `sales.xls`. **Asana** unbundled `tasks.xls`. They tilled their little plots of land, building specialized tools that were undeniably better than the generic junk the incumbents offered.

## The Landlord Era (Re-Bundling)

Then, the Landlords woke up.
Microsoft, Google, and Apple realized they owned the dirt (The OS, The Cloud, The Identity Provider).
They switched from Innovation to **Aggregation**.

### The Slack vs. Teams Massacre
Slack was a better product. Everyone knew it. It had better UI, better API documentation, better love.
But Microsoft didn't need to be better; they just needed to be **Free**.
They bundled Teams into Office 365.
*   **The Checkmate**: A CFO is not going to approve $15/user for Slack when Teams is "already paid for."

Microsoft realized that **Distribution** is a stronger moat than **Code**. Slack was forced to sell to Salesforce. The independent yeoman became a tenant of a different lord.

## Gravity is the Only Moat

In a feudal system, building a "cool feature" is not a moat. A competitor can copy your code in a week. **Feature Velocity is Rent, not Equity.**

The only real moats left are the ones the Landlords can't easily replicate with a software update:
1.  **Data Gravity**: Salesforce wins because moving 10 years of customer data is too painful to contemplate.
2.  **Workflow Integration**: Being embedded in the daily habit loop of the user.
3.  **Network Effects**: Everyone is already here.

## Conclusion: Sovereignty

For founders, the lesson is bleak but necessary.
Stop obsessing over your "Secret Sauce." Your code is a commodity.
Understand that you are building on rented land. The only way to win is to build **Sovereignty**—to own your relationship with the customer so deeply that not even a Landlord with a checkbox can evict you.
