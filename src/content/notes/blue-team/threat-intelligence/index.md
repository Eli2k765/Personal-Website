# Threat Intelligence (Identify)

"Know your enemy."

Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) involves analyzing information about adversaries—their capabilities, infrastructure, motives, and goals.

## Strategic vs Tactical
- **Strategic**: High-level trends for C-Suites ("Ransomware groups are targeting Healthcare").
- **Tactical**: TTPs for Hunters ("Group X uses PowerShell script Y").
- **Operational**: IOCs for SOC ("Block IP 1.2.3.4").
