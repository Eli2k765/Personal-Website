# Risk Management Frameworks

Choosing the right yardstick.

## 1. NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)
The gold standard for most US orgs.
- **5 Functions**:
  1.  **Identify**: Asset Management, Risk Assessment.
  2.  **Protect**: Access Control, Awareness Training.
  3.  **Detect**: Anomalies, Monitoring.
  4.  **Respond**: Mitigation, Analysis.
  5.  **Recover**: Recovery Planning.
- *Use Case*: "We need a common language to talk to the Board."

## 2. ISO 27001
International standard for Information Security Management Systems (ISMS).
- **Focus**: Heavy on documentation and PDCA (Plan-Do-Check-Act).
- *Use Case*: "We need to prove to European clients we are secure."

## 3. SOC 2 (Type II)
Auditing procedure that ensures service providers manage data securely.
- **Trust Principles**: Security, Availability, Processing Integrity, Confidentiality, Privacy.
- *Use Case*: "We are a SaaS company and enterprise customers won't buy without a SOC 2 report."

## 4. Risk Treatment
Once you find a risk (e.g., "Server is unpatched"), you have 4 choices:
1.  **Mitigate**: Patch it.
2.  **Transfer**: Buy Cyber Insurance.
3.  **Avoid**: Turn off the server.
4.  **Accept**: Sign a waiver saying "We know it might get hacked, but we need it."
