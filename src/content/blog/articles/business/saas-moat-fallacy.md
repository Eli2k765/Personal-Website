> "Your margin is my opportunity." — Jeff Bezos

In the golden age of SaaS (2010-2020), we believed in "Meritocracy."
We believed that "Best of Breed" would win. If you built the best chat app (Slack), you would beat the mediocre one (Teams).
We were wrong. We forgot that we don't live in a free market. We live in **Digital Feudalism**.

## Part I: The Unbundling of Excel (The Serf Era)

For 20 years, the strategy was "Unbundling."
*   **Salesforce** unbundled `sales.xls`.
*   **Asana** unbundled `tasks.xls`.
*   **Tableau** unbundled `charts.xls`.

SaaS startups were the creative yeoman farmers, tilling their little plots of land, building specialized tools that were undeniably better than the generic alternatives.

## Part II: The Re-Bundling (The Landlord Era)

Then, the Landlords woke up.
Microsoft, Google, and Apple realized they owned the dirt (The OS, The Cloud, The Identity Provider).
They switched from Innovation to **Aggregation**.

### Case Study: Slack vs. Microsoft Teams
Slack was better product. Better UI, better love, better API.
But Microsoft didn't need to be better; they just needed to be **Free**.
*   **The Bundle**: Teams was included in Office 365.
*   **The Checkmate**: A CFO will not pay $15/user for Slack when Teams is "Free" (already paid for).

Microsoft realized that **Distribution** is a stronger moat than **Code**.
Slack was forced to sell to Salesforce. The independent yeoman became a tenant of a different lord.

## Part III: Gravity is the Only Moat

In a feudal system, building a "cool feature" is not a moat. A competitor can copy your code in a week.
**Feature Velocity is Rent, not Equity.**
The only real moats left are the ones the Landlords can't easily replicate:
1.  **Data Gravity**: Salesforce wins because moving 10 years of data is too painful.
2.  **Workflow Integration**: Being embedded in the daily habit loop.
3.  **Network Effects**: Everyone is already there.

## Conclusion: Sovereignty

For founders and users, the lesson is bleak but necessary.
Stop obsessing over your "Secret Sauce." Your code is a commodity.
Understand that you are building on rented land.
The only way to win is to build **Sovereignty**—to own your data, to own your relationship with the customer, and to build something that cannot be "Bundled" away by a landlord with a checkbox.
